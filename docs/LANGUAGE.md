## General

## Supported types

### Integer

```
1
```

### Float

```
1.1
```

### Nil/Null

```
nil
```

### Strings

```
"hello"
```

### Booleans

```
true
false
```

### Arrays

```
let animals = ["bird", "horse", cat"]
print(animals[0])  # bird
```

### Hashmap

```
let weather = {"monday": "Rain", "tuesday": "Cloudy"}
```

Hashmap keys can be accessed using a dot syntax.

```
let colors = {"red": "FF0000"}
colors.red  # FF0000
```

## Variable assignment

```
let status = true
let msg = "hello"
let num = 1
let float = 1.1
```

Variables named or starting with `_` are discarded.


## Functions

Functions are first class and can be both named and anonymous, VÃ¤ja supports two types of function syntax:

Arrow syntax for short function declarations, where the last statement are automatically returned:

```
# Assigned to variable a
let a = fn () -> 1
a()  # 1

# Anonymous
map(["John", "Paul", "Ringo", "George"], fn (x) -> x)
```

And fn/end syntax, that allows multiline statments, `return` is optional

```
# Named function
fn hello(name)
  "hello " & name
end
hello("Martin")  # "hello Martin"

# Anonymous
map(["John", "Paul", "Ringo", "George"], fn (x)
  return x
end)
```

Closures look like this

```
fn adder(x)
  fn (y) -> x + y
end
adder(1)(2)  # 3
```

Named functions can be pattern matched

```
fn hello("john") -> "john sings"
fn hello("ringo") -> "ringo drums"
hello("john")  # "john sings"

fn hello(name, "whispers") -> name & " whispers"
fn hello(name, "sings") -> name & " sings"
hello("martin", "sings")  # "martin sings"
```

Parameters named `_` or with a `_` prefix will be ignored

```
fn hello(_) -> 1
fn greet(_name) -> 1
fn welcome(_, _, _) -> 1
```

IN PROGRESS: Anonymous functions can be curried

```
let add = fn'curry (x, y) -> x + y
add(1)(2)  # 3
```

## If/else

```
if (1 > 2) 1 end

if (1 > 2)
    1
else
    3
end

let value = if (1 > 2) true else false end

let value2 = if (false) 1 end  # nil
```

## Case

```
case (1 > 2)
    of true -> "It was true"
    of false -> "It was false"
    of _ -> "Anything goes?"
end
```

## Pipe operator

```
"hello" |> capitalize()  # HELLO
1 |> print()  # 1
```

## Iterators

```
map(a, fn (x) -> x)
map(a, fn (x)
    x
end)
```


## Builints

```
print("hello")
len("hello")
type(1)
```
